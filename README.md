## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;As a sincere and reliable software engineer, a passionate learner and an aspiring content creator who is familiar with Blockchain technology and has full-stack development experiences of more than 7 years, I obtained essential skills for web application development for further work of various aspects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength of me is that I am <strong>Always Sensitive</strong> to modern technologies and <strong>Open to New</strong> things. The past work shows that I understand and embody the needs of customers and be creative on their own.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think It is my greatest pleasure to <strong>Build and Maintain Trusts</strong> with all my customers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to say that I aim to be the <strong>Perfect Client-Oriented Developer</strong>.
